    <h4>1.	Business</h4>
    <p>We all believe that if we work in a particular field then we are good at it and we know all there is to know.</p>
    <p>However the one thing we shoukd never forget in the business world is that the customer is always right-even when they're wrong.</p>
    <p>As entrepreneurs, we,re agents of change. And we inevitably learn of our customers.</p>
    <p>We feel it's appropriate for us to explan to our target customer what's best for them and how they should behave</p>
    <p>But what we think doesn't matter. the only thing that matters is what customers say-even if we, as entrepreneurs , thnk they're dead wrong.</p>

    <p>You'll need to be able to demonstrate the passion and drive to succeed in the sport industry.</p>
    <p>Time management and making sure to having good worklife balance aea an important part of making  it in this field.</p>

    <h4>3.	Fashion</h4>
    <p>The idea of fashion and design seems very glamorous but remember that you always have to put in the work if it's your careeer.</p>
    <p>The first step in creating a successful fashion brand would be knowing that you have a product that is special and knowing who your target audience is.</p>
    <p>As a designer, you should be aware that you need to be proactive and present-talent is not enough.</p>
    <p>You need to get yourself out there and make sure everyone knows about you.</p>
    <p>It's all down to networking in person and online, developing new contacts and also utilizing the contacts you already have.</p>
    <h6>-Guccio Gucci was an Italian businessman and an iconic fashion designer.</h6>
    <P>  - </P>


    <h4>4.	Music</h4>
    <p>Doing well in the music industry requres much more than just recording a few good songs.</p>
    <p>Creating a good quality product is only half the battle, the other half is the promotion.</p>
    <p>If you make the mistake of putting all your time and money in recording your music and gettiing it onto the airwaves,</p>
    <P>You will soon find that you are making very few sales if any at all.</P>
    <p>If you don't put an equal amount of time into promoting your music , you probably won't get the kind ov results yiu were hoping for</p>
    <p>This is why you need to learn the business side of the industry, you can't rely on record labels to promote and maarket your music</p>
    <p>But it still needs to happen and you need to volunteer to make it happen for yourself.</p>
